## Overview

Welcome to the RAG-based PakGPT repository! This repository contains a demo of the Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based bot for answering queries related to the Constitution of Pakistan. This demo is designed to provide a quick overview of the system's capabilities.

This chatbot is built using retrieval-based and generation-based models to generate responses. It can understand and respond to user queries in a coherent and contextually relevant manner.

Key features of this chatbot:

- **Retrieval-Based Component**: This component retrieves relevant responses from a predefined knowledge base or a dataset of pre-written responses. It uses similarity measures or other retrieval techniques to select the most appropriate response.

- **Generation-Based Component**: When a suitable response is not found in the retrieval-based component, the chatbot can generate responses using a language model, ensuring that it can provide contextually appropriate answers to a wide range of questions.

- **Contextual Understanding**: The chatbot maintains context throughout the conversation, enabling it to provide coherent responses over multiple turns.

- **Customization**: The retrieval-based knowledge base can be easily customized to suit different use cases and domains.
